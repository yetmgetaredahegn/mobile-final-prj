## Overview

**dube** is a credit management app for local shops and mini-markets in Ethiopia. Shop owners who currently track customer debt using notebooks, memory, and verbal agreements can replace that with a real-time digital ledger. The core idea is that a shop owner extends credit to regular customers ("buy now, pay later"), and **dube** tracks exactly who owes how much, how old the debt is, and sends reminders when people are overdue.

The app has two interfaces in one:
- **Shop owner dashboard:** A full management dashboard to record credits, payments, and customer records.
- **Customer balance check:** Customers can view their own balance using a 6-digit PIN the owner shares with them—no customer account required.

## Features

- Real-time credit and payment tracking
- Overdue reminders to customers
- Two-in-one experience (owner + customer view)
- Ledger-style accounting for full auditability
- Mobile-first UX for local shops

## Powered by Firebase

**Used:**
- **Firebase Authentication** — email and password login for shop owners
- **Cloud Firestore** — main database storing shop owner profiles, customer records, and individual credit/payment transactions as separate documents
- **Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)** — push notifications for payment reminders

**Deliberately avoided:**
- **Firebase Storage** (no file uploads needed)
- **Firebase Hosting** (mobile-only app)
- **Paid third-party services** — SMS and email reminders use WhatsApp deep links and clipboard copy instead of services like Twilio or SendGrid

## Ledger Architecture (No Stored Balances)

**dube** never stores a customer’s balance as a database field. Balances are calculated live by summing all credit transactions and subtracting all payment transactions—exactly like a proper accounting ledger. This prevents data corruption and keeps the full history auditable.
